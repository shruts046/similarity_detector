**Similarity Detector Project**

The Similarity Detector project is a Java-based library focused on providing advanced utility functions for operations on sets and calculating similarities between different data sets. This library is particularly useful in fields like data analysis, machine learning, and computational biology, where set operations and similarity measures are frequently used.

**Project Structure**

SetUtilities.java: Contains utility functions for set operations, such as union, intersection, and set difference.
SimilarityUtilities.java: Provides methods for calculating similarities between data sets, potentially using algorithms like Jaccard similarity or cosine similarity.
SetUtilitiesTest.java: Unit tests for SetUtilities.java, ensuring the correctness of set operations.
SimilarityUtilitiesTest.java: Unit tests for SimilarityUtilities.java, validating the similarity measurement functions.

**Functionality**

Set Operations: The SetUtilities class offers a range of operations on sets, crucial for many data processing and analysis tasks.
Similarity Measurements: The SimilarityUtilities class implements algorithms to measure the similarity between data sets, which is vital in pattern recognition, clustering, and data deduplication.
Unit Testing: SetUtilitiesTest and SimilarityUtilitiesTest provide robust tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the utility classes.

**How to Set Up**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java installed on your system. 
Open the project using a Java-compatible IDE.

**How to Run**
Import the utility classes into your Java project.
Call the methods from SetUtilities and SimilarityUtilities as needed.
Run the test cases in SetUtilitiesTest and SimilarityUtilitiesTest to ensure functionality.
