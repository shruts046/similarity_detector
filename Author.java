     * From the syllabus:
     * 
     * Having a partner is optional for programming assignments.
     * 
     * You are free to work with different partners on each assignment. Especially
     * for programming assignments, make sure to acknowledge any past partners whose
     * work might have influenced your own in the Authors section.
     *
     * If you work with partner(s), you must do all the work together. It is against
     * the rules to split up the work, or to have one person do it and another
     * person "check" it, or to have one person write the code and another person
     * write the tests, etc. When you submit as a partnership or group, you are
     * asserting that all the work was done together.
     *
     * The above rule has implications for academic honesty policy violations. If
     * one of you is guilty, all of you are guilty. Consider that carefully. If your
     * partner went off and implemented a lot of code "on their own," how do you
     * know they wrote it? Every year, it turns out somebody actually copied the
     * code or solution from elsewhere. You will be culpable if your partner does
     * this, because by submitting as a partnership (or group) you are claiming the
     * solution to be jointly written by all of you.
     *
     * Nonetheless, much like exceeding the speed limit on the highway, if youâ€™re
     * going to violate the rules, there are norms. On the highway, that means
     * speeding in the left lane, and sticking to the speed limit in the right lane.
     * In this class, we likewise know some people will violate the rules and split
     * the work anyway. So if you do that, make sure to detail in the Author section
     * who did what work. That is your best defense should a violation of the
     * honesty policy be detected.
